Q. When using the combat augment array, how many dice for attacks can you modify at once?
A. One, attacks are considered separate rolls.

Q. Is bombardment affected by abilities that allow you to re-roll the hit roll, add 1 to the wound roll, etc.?

Q. If a unit loses a wound by a rad weapon and is under the effects of another rule reducing its toughness, which one doesn't affect it?

Q. For the rad furnace, what counts as a "similar ability"?
A. An ability that reduces the Strength and/or Toughness characteristic of a unit.

Q. Does bombardment count as an "Indirect Fire" weapon?
